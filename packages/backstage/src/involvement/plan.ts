/**
 * What an import would do, worked out before anything is written.
 *
 * The roster is the whole truth about who is involved: everyone on it is
 * verified, and everyone verified who is not on it loses that status. So the
 * plan is four lists, and the preview prints them before the confirmation.
 *
 * Preferred names are never changed: the roster's spelling may not be the
 * name a member goes by, and the preferred name is what the site shows. A
 * difference is listed for an officer to follow up on.
 *
 * A roster email finds its account the way `production/accounts.ts` says:
 * the profile's `ugaEmail` first, then the sign-in address.

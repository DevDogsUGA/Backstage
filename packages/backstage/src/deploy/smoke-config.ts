/**
 * Which host serves which app at which tier, and which routes are safe to
 * smoke-test unauthenticated: the per-app data `deploy smoke` and
 * `deploy reconcile` need.
 *
 * It stays in DevDogsUGA, as a `smoke` field on each app's entry in
 * `workers.json`, because it describes the apps (their routes, their auth
 * redirect) and changes with them:
 *
 *   { "path": "apps/platform", "smoke": {
 *       "hosts": { "staging": "staging.devdogsuga.org", "production": "devdogsuga.org" },
 *       "publicPaths": ["/", "/events"],
 *       "protectedPath": "/console/permissions",
 *       "protectedRedirectPrefix": "/auth" } }
 *
 * Until that field exists in a checkout, `FALLBACK_SMOKE` (the table
 * DevDogsUGA's `packages/deploy-checks` carried) answers for the two apps that
 * had one, so the commands work against a checkout from before the move. An
 * entry that has the field always wins. An app with neither has no smoke
 * test, which is said rather than treated as a pass.
 *
 * Meaning of the fields:
 *
 *   * `publicPaths`: root-relative paths expected to answer 200 with no
 *     session. A deliberately small, stable set of informational routes.
 *   * `protectedPath`: one route an anonymous visitor cannot reach directly.
 *     It can be a synthetic path when the app gates everything not on its
 *     public allowlist.
 *   * `protectedRedirectPrefix`: what the `Location` of the anonymous request
 *     to `protectedPath` must start with.

/**
 * The `--secrets-file` a `wrangler deploy` uploads with one Worker.
 *
 * `deploy <app>` writes it, uploads it and removes it. Runs with `process.env` holding
 * the environment `deploy write-env` composed. It reads no GitHub context of
 * its own: one place in the pipeline touches `secrets` and `vars`, and this is
 * not it.
 *
 * ## Which keys, and why they are derived rather than listed
 *
 * `buildWorkerEnv(app, env, "deploy")` in `@devdogsuga/env`, the same function
 * `with-env` uses for the env file `wrangler dev` reads, so what runs locally
 * and what is uploaded cannot drift apart. It is `storableKeys()` intersected
 * with the keys the app's own manifest declares. A hand-written list per
 * Worker is the exact failure the registry was built to remove: a variable
 * added to `src/env.ts` and forgotten in the list is simply absent from the
 * deployed environment, and the first thing that reads it fails at run time in
 * production.
 *
 * Two exclusions follow from that rule rather than being special cases:
 *
 *   * `:tooling` sources — declared for the deploy pipeline itself, not for
 *     the Worker. A key the deploy needs is not automatically a key the WORKER
 *     needs, and sending one anyway hands an internet-facing Worker a
 *     credential it never asks for.
 *   * `client: true` declarations, inlined into the browser bundle at build
 *     time and not Worker secrets at all (§A.6.3).
 *
 * ## ⚠️ Always the complete set
 *
 * `wrangler deploy --secrets-file` applies ADDITIVELY: it preserves every
 * secret it does not mention, which may be one another environment set. A
 * partial file inherits stale values silently rather than failing. So this
 * sends everything the app declares, every time, and `env audit`
 * reports whatever the Worker is still holding that nothing declares any more.
 *
 * ## Minted keys are refused, not filled
 *
 * A `secrecy: "secret"` key `storableKeys()` excludes is "minted": signed at
 * deploy time rather than stored anywhere, which is what `SANDBOX_PROXY_TOKEN`
 * is declared as. This has no minter of its own — there is nothing in
 * this repository that produces one — so a declared minted key is always a
 * hard failure here rather than a silent omission: a Worker that expects a
 * value substituted fails loudly at the file it never got, not at whatever
 * reads it.
 *
 * ## Cleanup
 *
 * `deploy <app>` removes the directory when the upload is done. The legacy
 * step writes `dir=` and `file=` to `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` and the workflow removes
 * `dir` in an `if: always()` step.

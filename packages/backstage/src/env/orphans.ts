/**
 * Worker secrets nothing declares: the check `env audit` runs for its target
 * (`--prune` deletes what it finds).
 *
 * Reports, and only when asked deletes, Worker secrets nothing declares.
 *
 * ## Why there is anything to audit
 *
 * `wrangler deploy --secrets-file` applies additively: it preserves every
 * secret it does not mention. So renaming a variable, or dropping one, leaves
 * the old secret on the Worker indefinitely, and nothing else in the system can
 * see it. Bitwarden does not know about it, GitHub does not, and the app's
 * schema stopped mentioning it. Cloudflare will hold a credential nobody has
 * thought about for a year.
 *
 * The expected set is derived from the app's own manifest: every key it
 * declares with `secrecy: "secret"`. That deliberately includes the MINTED
 * ones. A minted key has no copy in Bitwarden or GitHub by design, and an
 * audit that reasoned from stored copies alone would report a live credential
 * as safe to delete. (`env audit` had exactly that bug; see
 * `EnvMeta.minted`.)
 *
 * ## Report always, prune almost never (security plan §3.6)
 *
 *   report   every production deploy      environment: production
 *   prune    `workflow_dispatch` only     environment: production-apply
 *
 * **Orphans never fail the deploy.** A stale secret name is not a defect in the
 * change being deployed, and failing on it would make an unrelated commit
 * responsible for a cleanup somebody else deferred. So the reporting path
 * returns normally even when it found something; the only non-zero exit here is
 * a deletion that was asked for and did not happen.
 *
 * **Pruning must not chain to a deploy.** Deleting a secret publishes a new
 * version of the currently deployed code with the secret gone. There is no way
 * to change a secret without publishing. Auto-pruning would turn every deploy
 * carrying an orphan into TWO version publishes, and the second one bypasses
 * both the promotion PR and the `production-apply` approval that the first went
 * through. That is why this is a separate, human-triggered run, and why
 * `--prune` is the only thing that can reach `deleteSecret`: a default that
 * deleted would be a default that deployed.
 *
 * > **Names only.** Cloudflare never returns a secret's value, so a secret
 * > whose VALUE is wrong is undetectable here. A clean audit means "no name is
 * > unaccounted for", not "the configuration is correct".
 *
 * Recovery from a wrong prune is real but not instant: Bitwarden is the source
 * of truth and every deploy sends the complete set, so a wrongly deleted secret
 * comes back on the next deploy, with an outage in between.
 *
 * ## Interface
 *
 * Reads secret NAMES from Cloudflare and needs no env file, so CI runs it with
 * `--no-env`: there is no `.env.production` in the job that audits, and
 * demanding one would be demanding the whole credential set to list some
 * names.

/**
 * `backstage env <pull|push|audit> --target <target>` (plus `--prune` on audit)
 *
 *   pull   Bitwarden into your env file
 *   push   your env file to Bitwarden, then to GitHub secrets AND variables
 *   audit  compare the file, Bitwarden, GitHub and Cloudflare, and list the Worker
 *          secrets no app declares (--prune deletes them)
 *
 * ⚠️ THE FILE IS DERIVED FROM THE TARGET, and that one line was this
 * module's bug. `pathFor()` used to default to the root `.env` regardless of
 * target and honour only an explicit `--file`, while `init` mapped target to
 * file the way the table always said. So `push --env staging` uploaded the
 * DEVELOPMENT file to the staging project and reported success. Neither
 * subcommand was internally wrong; they read two different enums behind one
 * flag name. `--file` remains, as an override somebody types on purpose.
 *
 * Four rules shape all of it:
 *
 *   * **Nothing is overwritten or removed without being asked.** Every
 *     destructive change is listed in fingerprints and confirmed. `push` sends
 *     to Bitwarden AND GitHub because a value in one and not the other is the
 *     failure this design has.
 *   * **Bitwarden holds an entire target, not its secret half.** The public
 *     per-environment values (`PROJECT_REF`, `BASE_URL`, `PUBLISHABLE_KEY`,
 *     and so on) are stored there too and pushed on to GitHub as *variables*
 *     rather than secrets. Storing them as secrets would mask them by
 *     substring in every log line they appear in and make their values
 *     unreadable to `audit`; leaving them out of Bitwarden would mean `pull`
 *     reconstructs a file that cannot boot an app.
 *   * **Nothing is deleted from the file.** A key that should go away is
 *     commented out, so the previous value stays recoverable from the file.
 *   * **Values are never printed.** Fingerprints tell a rotation from a paste
 *     error and cannot be used to reconstruct anything.

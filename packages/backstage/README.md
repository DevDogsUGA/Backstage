# @devdogsuga/backstage

The officer and production CLI: everything that needs production secrets and is
used only by the two people who hold them (and CI), plus the tools that need
only the user's own login. Run it anywhere:

```bash
pnpm dlx --config.minimum-release-age=0 --config.dlx-cache-max-age=0 @devdogsuga/backstage
```

It always runs the latest publish, CI included, so local runs and CI runs
match. The two flags matter outside a DevDogsUGA checkout, where the workspace's
`minimumReleaseAgeExclude` and `dlxCacheMaxAge: 0` do not apply (inside one,
`pnpm backstage` is the script).

It **starts without a checkout**. Help, `version`, `completions`, the tools
below that need no secrets (`graphics`, `qr`, `github`, `newsletter`, `creds`) and
anything run with `--no-env` never look for one; a command that reads a checkout says
"run this from inside a DevDogsUGA clone" and exits 1. The DevDogsUGA libraries
it reads (`@devdogsuga/env`, `@devdogsuga/db`) are optional peers, resolved
through the checkout by the commands that need them.

```bash
pnpm backstage                                   # no arguments: a menu
pnpm backstage env pull --target production      # Bitwarden → .env.production
pnpm backstage env audit --target production     # every store, plus orphaned Worker secrets
pnpm backstage env audit --target production --prune
pnpm backstage deploy platform --tier staging    # token check, secrets file, wrangler deploy
pnpm backstage --no-env deploy write-env         # the CI steps that supply their own environment
pnpm backstage --no-env planner status           # the preflight credential, from DB_URL
pnpm backstage graphics 'event/*' --out ~/images # club images, no checkout
pnpm backstage qr https://devdogsuga.org --format svg,png,webp --logo acm
pnpm backstage newsletter send 3.0.1 --to a@uga.edu   # asks first; --yes with no terminal
pnpm backstage creds                             # share a club login with officers, as a Bitwarden Send
pnpm backstage creds renew                       # extend every Send 30 days
```

`smoke` and `reconcile` replace DevDogsUGA's `packages/deploy-checks`. The
per-app data (hosts, public paths, the protected path and its redirect) stays in
DevDogsUGA, as a `smoke` field on each app's entry in `workers.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "path": "apps/platform",
    "smoke": {
      "hosts": {
        "staging": "staging.devdogsuga.org",
        "production": "devdogsuga.org"
      },
      "publicPaths": ["/", "/events"],
      "protectedPath": "/console/permissions",
      "protectedRedirectPrefix": "/auth"
    }
  },
  "apps/sandbox"
]
```

Entries may be bare paths or objects. While the field is absent, the table
`deploy-checks` carried answers for `platform` and `schedule-builder`.

## The tools that need no production secrets

None of these reads an env file or needs a checkout, so the launcher skips env
entry for them (`envFree` in the command tree).

- **`graphics`** renders the brand, app and event images with
  `@devdogsuga/brand/render`, reading meetings from the published
  `@devdogsuga/events`. Files go to `--out` or the current directory, flat, as
  `<name>-<format>.png`. There is no `page/*` group (the platform renders page
  cards per request) and no `--default-out`.
- **`qr`** takes its options from `qrRequestSchema` in `@devdogsuga/brand/qr`,
  the same schema `/console/qr` parses, so a new option reaches both. Every
  schema field has a flag (`qr/options.ts` is typed over the schema, and a test
  checks it): content, `--size`, `--margin`, `--color`, `--background`,
  `--gradient`, `--shape`, `--error-level`, `--qr-version`, `--logo` (a preset,
  `none`, or an image file) with `--logo-size`, `--logo-padding` and
  `--logo-crop x,y,w,h`, and `--format` with any of svg, png, jpg, webp, avif
  and tiff at once. It prints the same scannability warning as the page.
  `/console/qr` stays, deprecated; new options are CLI-only.
- **`github rulesets|settings`** keep GitHub's rulesets and repository settings
  as code, through `gh` and your own login. They must keep matching what the
  platform's `server/github/rulesets.ts` and `teamSync.ts` assume.
- **`newsletter render|draft|send`** are described in the
  [newsletter package](../newsletter/README.md). Drafts and sends use the club
  mailbox (`devdogs@uga.edu`) with the officer's own Microsoft sign-in; there
  is no `--mailbox`. `send` needs `--to` and always asks first, naming the issue
  and every recipient; with no terminal, `--yes` answers it. The sign-in
  borrows Thunderbird's public client ID (see `src/newsletter/oauth.ts`); if
  Microsoft or UGA's tenant blocks it, sending needs a club-owned app
  registration.

## Shared logins: `creds`

The club's shared logins (Instagram, Canva, ArchPass, Linktree, later project
API keys) live only in the **Shared Accounts** collection of the DevDogs
Bitwarden organization. `creds` hands them to officers as Bitwarden Sends:

- **`send`** picks items and recipients (officers by name or by role, read live
  from production: everyone holding a role other than `Member`, by UGA MyID
  email), shows a preview with the password masked as `••••••••`, then creates
  or updates **one Send per item**, restricted by email verification to its
  recipients and deleted 30 days out. Removing an address revokes it. Addresses
  off the roster need `--allow-email`. Non-interactive: `--item`, `--to`,
  `--role`, `--yes`.
- **`add`** saves a new login into the collection (org-owned), then sends it.
  The password is typed at a hidden prompt, or read with `--password-stdin`;
  never argv.
- **`renew`** pushes each Send's deletion 30 days out in place (the link stays)
  and re-syncs its recipients and body from the item. It asks first for any Send
  with more than 7 days left.
- **`list`** prints items, recipients and expiry (`--json` for scripts).
- **`report`** regenerates the **Shared Accounts** Linear document (Platform &
  DevOps initiative), which `send`, `add` and `renew` also do. It is generated
  whole; edits there are overwritten.

Each item's custom fields are the only access record: `Recipients`, `Owner`,
`Send ID`, `Send link`, `Send expires`, `Send account`. Sends belong to the
Bitwarden account that creates them, so `creds` runs on your own `bw` session
(signing in and unlocking after asking, or `BW_SESSION`), never on CI; renewing
a Send another officer made creates a new one, with a new link, under yours.

The roster needs production's `DB_URL`: `--db-url`, else `.env.production` in a
checkout, else Secrets Manager. The Linear key: `--linear-token`, then
`LINEAR_API_KEY`, then the vault item "DevDogs Linear API key (backstage)", then
a prompt; it is never saved.

No secret value reaches stdout, stderr, the failure log, Sentry, an error
message or argv: values go to `bw` as base64 JSON on stdin, every error is
scrubbed of every value read so far (`src/creds/secrets.ts`), and the clipboard
only ever gets the link. `src/creds/commands.test.ts` runs every path against a
fake `bw` with a sentinel password and looks for it in all of those places.

## Tiers, `--no-env`, CI

Nothing is ever asked at launch. `--tier <t>` (anywhere in argv) or
`DEPLOY_ENV` names the session's tier and so the env file loaded; with neither
the session is plain development (where `BWS_ACCESS_TOKEN` lives). `deploy`
refuses to run without one of the two.

`--no-env` loads no env files and does not look for a checkout: the caller's
environment is the environment. It is for `deploy write-env`, which creates the
file tier resolution would otherwise insist on reading, and for CI steps that
hold one narrow credential in the job's `env:` block.

With no terminal, or `CI=true`: no menu, no banner, plain lines, errors on
stderr, and every confirmation needs `--yes`. Against staging or production a
command that is not read-only asks once first (`--yes` answers it).

Each command checks for the secrets it uses up front: `deploy <app>` for
`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `deploy reconcile` for `CRON_SECRET`, `env` for the
Secrets Manager token (flag, environment, then the Bitwarden vault, which `env`
signs in to and unlocks itself, then asking).

## Layout

Like devtools: `src/<domain>/catalog.ts` (inert data) and `commands.ts`;
`src/catalog.ts` composes the tree, `src/cli.ts` maps names to handlers,
`src/launch-core.ts` settles the tier before any command is imported. The
shared core is the private `@devdogsuga/cli-core`, which `tsdown` inlines; every
other import must be declared here, and the build fails when one is not.

`env.ts` is the operator manifest (`BWS_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
and friends). It is a copy of devtools' own, kept identical by a test, because
each CLI loads the one beside it.

Contract tests (`pnpm test:contract`) pack the real tarball, install it with
install scripts off outside any repo (and check the Bitwarden native module
loads), and run it again inside the fixture repo. They gate publishing.

Crash reporting is the same as devtools' (Sentry, scrubbed, off with
`DEVTOOLS_TELEMETRY=0`); the release is named `backstage@<version>`.

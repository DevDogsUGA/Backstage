/**
 * The club's brand identity: palette, contact/social copy, embedded fonts, the
 * mark/wordmark artwork, and the Satori templates (banner, app icon, event and
 * page cards) that render them.
 *
 * The templates take their own `width` and `height` rather than assuming one
 * size; see `formats.ts` for the renditions. Nothing here imports a renderer,
 * which is what lets two callers share them: `./next` renders through
 * `next/og` in an app's Worker, and `./render` through Satori and resvg in
 * Node. A consumer that wants only colours should take `./palette.css` or
 * `PALETTE`, and one that wants only the app marks `./marks`; both skip the
 * embedded fonts and artwork this entry carries.
 *
 * `@devdogsuga/brand/event` is a SEPARATE entry point and deliberately so —
 * see `event.ts` for why: it holds the club's timezone and the
 * meeting-to-card formatting, and importing it must not drag this module's
 * embedded fonts and artwork along.

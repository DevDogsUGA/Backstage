/**
 * devtools' command tree, composed from each domain's `catalog.ts`.

 * Every domain declares its own commands next to the handlers that run them

 * how the root help and the wizard group them. Paths do not change when a
 * command moves between groups. Importing it runs nothing, so the launcher can
 * read it before the session's environment is entered.

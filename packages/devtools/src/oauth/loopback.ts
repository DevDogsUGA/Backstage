/**
 * The loopback HTTP listener the one-click connect flow waits on.
 *
 * `devtools oauth`'s connect flow opens the platform's `/tools/oauth/connect`
 * page in the contributor's browser, and the platform redirects back to a
 * `redirect_uri` of `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/callback` this process itself
 * is listening on — a random, ephemeral port, requested by passing `0` to
 * `listen()`, so two `devtools oauth` runs on the same machine never
 * collide. `127.0.0.1` specifically, not `0.0.0.0`: this must never accept a
 * connection from anything but the browser running ON this machine.
 *
 * Every exit path — success, `error=access_denied` (or any other `error=`),
 * a request with neither, and the 5-minute timeout — closes the server
 * exactly once. That is the one invariant every caller of `start()` may
 * lean on: `close()` (also exposed for a caller that gives up early, e.g.
 * Ctrl-C) is always safe to call more than once, and the server is never
 * left listening after `result` settles.

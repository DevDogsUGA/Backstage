/**
 * devtools' own Sentry wiring — the CLI is a consumer of
 * `@devdogsuga/telemetry` like `apps/platform`, `apps/schedule-builder`, and
 * `apps/sandbox`, but on `@sentry/node` rather than a framework SDK: a CLI
 * process starts, runs one command, and exits, with none of a server's
 * request lifecycle for a framework integration to hook into.
 *
 * ## Reporting is on by default
 *
 * Every other `*_SENTRY_DSN` in this org is optional-and-empty until
 * configured (see `@devdogsuga/telemetry`'s no-op-without-DSN contract), and
 * so is this one — empty means `buildSentryOptions` returns `undefined` and
 * `Sentry.init` never runs — but the DEFAULT here is reporting ON once a DSN
 * exists, unlike a feature a contributor opts into. `DEVTOOLS_TELEMETRY=0` is
 * the one escape hatch, checked before `Sentry.init` and before every capture
 * call, so it also works as a kill switch after init already ran (a
 * long-lived `pnpm devtools` menu session, for instance).
 *
 * ## Where the DSN comes from
 *
 * Baked in at build time, not read from the consumer's environment: devtools
 * runs on contributors' machines, where no `.env` could be relied on to carry
 * it. `scripts/write-build-info.mjs` writes `dist/build-info.json` from the
 * build's `DEVTOOLS_SENTRY_DSN`, which Backstage's `publish.yaml` sets from
 * the repo's Actions variable of the same name. Every other build bakes ""
 * and reports nothing. `DEVTOOLS_SENTRY_DSN` in the run-time environment still
 * wins, for pointing a local build at a test project.

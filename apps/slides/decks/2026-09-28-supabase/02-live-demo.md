# Build It Live

<!-- Presenter notes: Sloan is back at the podium. Shruti's concepts map onto real code now: two laptops, one Supabase project, projected side by side. Both laptops type the code live (or paste it from the slides); if one presenter is alone, drive the web side and paste the Flutter side from the slides. Every code slide builds the step up one chunk per click, with a tip at the bottom; the Discord button posts the whole step, whichever click you're on. -->

- Create a Supabase project at **supabase.com/dashboard** (it takes about a minute)
- Copy the **Project URL** and the **publishable key** from Project Settings → API
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and paste them in

> [!WARNING]
> The publishable key is safe in your app. The **secret** key never is: keep it out of `.env.local`, and out of git.

<!-- Presenter notes: Create the project live on both laptops. The URL looks like https://<ref>.supabase.co and the key starts with sb_publishable_. Both apps use a file called .env.local: Next.js loads it automatically, and Flutter reads it when you run with `--dart-define-from-file=.env.local`. The publishable key is safe in the app; the secret key never is. This is the part most likely to eat time, so budget for it; a lead can drive if the room lags. Sign-in setup waits until step 2. -->

`"use client"` marks this module for the browser: the Supabase client runs in the page.

`process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_…` reads the values from `.env.local`. Next.js only hands the browser variables that start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.

`main` is now `async`, so it can `await` setup before `runApp`. `ensureInitialized` readies Flutter's plugins first.

`type Message` describes one row of the `messages` table, so TypeScript can check how we use it.

`useState` holds the messages this component shows; setting it re-renders the list.

`useEffect` runs after the first render, and the empty `[]` means just once. It asks Supabase for the rows, newest first.

`Supabase.instance.client` is the client `main.dart` set up, shared by the whole app.

A `StatefulWidget` keeps data that changes in its `State`. `initState` runs once, when it's created: the place to start loading.

A `Future` with `async`/`await` waits for the database without freezing the screen. `setState` redraws with the new rows.

# Sign In with OAuth

**OIDC** (OpenID Connect) is a standard built on OAuth 2.0. It lets your app send people to another service to sign in (here, DevDogs), then tells your app who they are.

<!-- Presenter notes: No SQL this step. First register the app with DevDogs and add the provider in the Dashboard (next two slides), then the client code. -->

# Register Your App with DevDogs

- Go to **devdogsuga.org/tools/oauth** and create a client
- Redirect URI: your **Project URL** + `/auth/v1/callback`
  - For example, `https://abcdefghij.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
- Copy the **client ID** and **client secret**

> [!WARNING]
> The client secret is shown once. Keep the tab open until you've pasted it into Supabase, next.

# Add the Provider in Supabase

<details>
<summary>Why <code>custom:</code>, and why a <code>supabase.co</code> issuer?</summary>

Supabase requires a custom provider's identifier to start with `custom:`, which is why the app signs in with `custom:devdogsuga`.

The issuer is the DevDogs Supabase project's own host, not `api.devdogsuga.org`: Supabase's OAuth server reports that host in its discovery document and ID tokens, so a provider set to the custom domain fails the issuer check. Your OAuth page shows the current issuer with a copy button.

</details>

<!-- Presenter notes: Supabase requires custom provider identifiers to start with `custom:`, which is why the app signs in with `custom:devdogsuga`. The issuer is the raw project host, not api.devdogsuga.org: Supabase's OAuth server ignores the custom domain in its discovery document and ID tokens, and a provider set to api.devdogsuga.org fails the issuer check (TASK-347). The OAuth page shows the current issuer with a copy button. `devtools oauth` does all of this in one command; it comes back in the local bonus section at the end. -->

Signing in only needs the client we already have: it's all under `supabase.auth`.

</template>
<template #1>

`Session` is supabase-js's type for a signed-in user; `null` means nobody's signed in.

</template>
<template #2>

`onAuthStateChange` calls back on every sign-in and sign-out. The function `useEffect` returns unsubscribes when the component goes away.

</template>
<template #3>

`signInWithOAuth` sends the browser to DevDogs, then back to `redirectTo`. The cast is there because TypeScript only knows Supabase's built-in providers.

</template>
<template #4>

`signOut` ends the session, and `onAuthStateChange` updates the page.

`{session ? … : …}` in JSX picks which button to show.

`kIsWeb` says whether we're in a browser: come back to this page on the web, or to the app's deep link on a phone.

</template>
<template #2>

`Session?`: the `?` means it can be `null`, i.e. signed out.

</template>
<template #3>

`onAuthStateChange` is a `Stream`. `listen` runs on every sign-in and sign-out, and `setState` redraws.

</template>
<template #4>

`OAuthProvider('custom:devdogsuga')` is our custom provider, and `=>` is shorthand for a one-line function.

`build` copies `_session` into a local, so Dart knows it can't change halfway through.

`session == null ? … : …` picks which button to show.

<!-- Presenter notes: Because the contributor's own GoTrue is the relying party, sign-in mints a native session in auth.users, so auth.uid() just works with the RLS policies coming up.

Controlled inputs: each field's text lives in state (`useState`) and updates on every keystroke.

`handleSubmit` is `async`, so it can `await` the database. `preventDefault` stops the browser's own page-reloading submit.

# What's Wrong with This?

Think about it before you open the answer.

<details>
<summary>Show the answer</summary>

The **app** decides whose name goes on each message: type any name you like, and the database stores it. Nothing ties the name to the person who's signed in.

A client is just a program anyone can change: they can edit the request, or call the API directly. Row-level security checks who you are (`auth.uid() = user_id`), but nothing checks the name.

</details>

<!-- Presenter notes: Ask the room first and take a few guesses before clicking to reveal. The insert trusts a name the client sends, and a client is just a program anyone can change: type someone else's name, edit the request, or call the API directly.

A `profiles` table: one row per person, keyed by their `auth.users` id.

</template>
<template #1>

Names are public, so everyone can read profiles. There's no write policy: only the trigger below writes here.

</template>
<template #2>

A function that runs as its owner (`security definer`), so it can write a profile the signed-in user can't.

</template>
<template #3>

It inserts one profile for each new user…

</template>
<template #4>

…named by `coalesce`: the first of `name`, `full_name`, `preferred_username`, or the start of the email.

</template>
<template #5>

The trigger runs that function every time someone signs up.

The backfill gives everyone who signed up before tonight a profile too.

Messages now point at profiles, and the `author_name` column goes away.

</template>
</CodeTips>

<details>
<summary>Why <code>security definer</code> and an empty <code>search_path</code>?</summary>

`security definer` runs the function as the table's owner, so it can write to `profiles` even though signed-in users have no write policy there. `set search_path = ''` stops it from being tricked by a same-named function or table planted earlier in a caller's search path.

</details>

<!-- Presenter notes: One paste, on one laptop (shared project); the clicks walk it. A profiles table with the same shape as messages: create, RLS on, one read-for-everyone policy. Then the trigger function: security definer + empty search_path so it can write to profiles even though the signed-in user has no write policy there, and can't be tricked by a planted function; the name comes from the first of name, full_name, preferred_username, or the email prefix. The trigger runs it on every sign-up, the backfill covers anyone who signed up before this ran, and the last change points messages at profiles and removes the author_name column. -->

<CodeTips>
<template #0>

Deleting takes a handler and a button, shown only on your own messages.

</template>
<template #1>

`_delete` removes the row, then reloads the list.

</template>
<template #2>

`isOwnMessage` compares the signed-in user to the message's author; only then does the tile get a delete button.

</template>
</CodeTips>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Hiding the button isn't what protects other people's messages: the delete policy is. Postgres refuses to delete someone else's message, whatever the app shows.

<!-- Presenter notes: The delete button only renders for your own rows client-side, but the real guard is the RLS policy: try deleting someone else's id from devtools or curl and Postgres refuses it regardless of what the UI shows. -->

# Everything We Clicked, as Files

Everything so far ran in your Supabase project's Dashboard. This page turns the same SQL into migration files in the repo, and runs the whole stack on your machine.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This page is optional, and needs [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) running.

<!-- Presenter notes: Demo only: nobody needs to follow along, and it needs Docker. Everything so far ran in the shared project's Dashboard; this turns the same SQL into migration files in the repo, which is how the monorepo works. Before starting: `supabase stop` any other local stack on this laptop (same ports, 54321-54324). -->

```bash

pnpm dlx supabase status
```

> [!TIP]
> The first `supabase start` downloads Docker images, which takes a few minutes. If another local Supabase stack is running, stop it first with `pnpm dlx supabase stop` in its folder: they use the same ports.

<!-- Presenter notes: start boots Postgres, Auth, and Studio in Docker (the first run downloads images, so do it before the meeting). status prints the local API URL (http://127.0.0.1:54321), Studio (http://127.0.0.1:54323), and the local publishable key. Open Studio: it's the same dashboard, empty. -->

Each `migration new` creates an empty, timestamped file under supabase/migrations; `db reset` rebuilds the local database from those files, so anyone who clones the repo gets the same schema. -->

Built-in providers like Apple, GitHub or Google are config: a block in `supabase/config.toml`, with the secret in an environment variable. DevDogs is a custom provider, so it isn't in `config.toml`, and `db reset` wipes one you set up by hand.

</details>

::second::

```bash
# Register "Sign in with DevDogs" on the local stack
# (a custom provider, so it isn't in config.toml)
pnpm dlx @devdogsuga/devtools oauth
```

Then point `.env.local` at the local API URL and publishable key from `supabase status`, restart the app, and sign in against your own machine.

> [!NOTE]
> Run `devtools oauth` again after every `db reset`.

<!-- Presenter notes: Built-in providers like Apple, GitHub, or Google are just config: a block like this one in supabase/config.toml, with the secret in an env var. DevDogs is a custom OIDC provider, so it isn't in config.toml, and `db reset` wipes the one we set up by hand. Click: `devtools oauth` registers it on the local stack in one step. Then point `.env.local` at the local URL and publishable key from `supabase status`, restart the app, and sign in against your own machine. -->

The monorepo works exactly like this: every schema change is a migration under `supabase/migrations`.

<!-- Presenter notes: One sentence, then move on to the competition. The `02-supabase` branches (with these migrations) go public on GitHub right after tonight's workshop. -->

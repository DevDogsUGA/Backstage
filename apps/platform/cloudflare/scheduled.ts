/**
 * Cron expression to the routes it fires and a one-line description of the
 * group's purpose.
 *
 * A list per expression, not a single route: Cloudflare fires each schedule
 * once, and more than one pass can want the same cadence. With a bare
 * `Record<string, string>` the second five-minute pass added would have
 * silently replaced the first: a whole subsystem quietly not running, with
 * nothing to notice it by.
 *
 * `label` carries the purpose in English so devtools `cron list` can print it
 * without reading source comments. The shape is enforced by devtools' zod
 * schema at its import boundary.
 *
 * `monitorSlug` and `monitor` are extra fields devtools' `CronEntry` schema
 * does not know about and does not need to: `z.object` ignores unmodelled
 * keys rather than rejecting them, so this stays a single source of truth for
 * "what fires on this schedule" AND "what Sentry Crons monitor covers it,"
 * without a second table that could drift from this one. `monitor` upserts
 * the Sentry monitor's schedule/margins on every check-in (see `scheduled()`
 * below) so the config lives next to the table instead of only in the Sentry
 * dashboard.
 *
 * Only one group has a monitor: Sentry bills a seat per monitor, and the plan
 * covers one. A group without one declares a `heartbeat` instead, recorded
 * when every route in it succeeds, and the monitored group's
 * `/cron/heartbeats` route fails while that record is overdue (see
 * `~/server/heartbeats/jobs`). Dropping a `monitorSlug` is enough to retire its
 * monitor: `backstage deploy prune-monitors` deletes undeclared ones.
